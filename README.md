Two-layer-Neural-Network
Description -I have implemented the neural network in such a way that it'll give us all the outputs using all the activation functions. - Firslty I have defined all the required activation functions like sigmoid, relu and tanh. - Secondly defined the model(forward and backward propagation) with all the activation functions, so that we can compare the results, which is best of all, which is overfitting, underfitting or the perfect fit.
